* Importance of preservation
** Increase shelf-life of foods
** Increase availibility
*** seasonality
*** longer selling periods for fruits/veggies
** Variety and convenience
*** easy to prepare food
*** microwave dinner
** Adding value
** Providing (supplementing) nutrients

* Principles of Food Preservation
** Prevention or delay of microbial decomp
*** dehydrated/instant mash potatoes must undergo heat treatment to prevent browning of potatoes
** Killing the microorganisms
** Prevention or delay of self decomposition
** prevention of damage

* Food Processing
** transforming animal/plant/marine materials into intermediate or finished value added products
*** Any processing after killng or harvest
** Different steps that happen after harvest depending on what food is being processed
** Then the products will undergo distribution
*** packaging and shipping for different retailers
** Primary Processing
*** initial processing that occurs after harvest or slaughter to make food consumption redy, or for use in other food products
*** food can be eaten directly, otherwise it will be used to make another food product
** Secondary Processing
*** turns primary processed foods into other food products
*** creating a pineapple upsidown cake

* Food/Beverage
** 16% of all shipments in the US by value

* Unit opertions in food processing
** Unit operation = steps
** food material may be combined with a number of ingredients to formulate the product and these ingredients are subjected to different steps (unit operations) to produce the final product
** combining these unit operations will create a process flow chart
1. Heat Transfer
   - heat exchange between a product and its surrounding medium
   - cooking your product
   - must have a temperature gradient
   - heat transfer will not occur if there is no temperature difference
   - cooling a product is also considered a heat transfer
2. Mass Transfer
   - migration of constituient of fluid or a component of mixture in or out of a food product
   - seperating or removing a portion of the raw material
   - dehydrated or dried products (removing water)
3. Fluid Flow
   - Transporting fluid food through pipes during processing
4. Mixing
   - Use to evenly distribute each ingredient during manufacturing of a food product
   - during further processing it is important that food is porperly mixed so the following steps apply in th same fassion to all pieces
5. Size Adjustment
   - Food is either reduced into smaller pieces or in some instances increase in size is also possible
   - can be an increase or decrease in size
   - agglomeration - increase in size
   - gelation - forming a 3d network of proteins
6. Seperation
   - Seperation and recovery of targeted food components from a complex mixture of compounds

* Factors to consider in food processing
1. Raw material testing
2. Cleaning and sanitation
   - Clean and healthy workers
3. Engineering properties of food, biological and packaging material
   - how does a material conduct heat?
4. Acidity and water activity
   - pH and water activity of the material
5. Microbiological considerations
6. Reaction Kinetics
   - what are the changes in the componenets of the food that occur when processing is performed
   - does killing the microbacteria remove vitamins?
   - does it alter the color or taste?
   - we dont want to alter the nutritional quality by removing microorganisms/pathogens

* Emerging Issues and Sustainability in Food Processing
** Feeding the world
** Overcoming the negative perceptions about processed foods
*** 5-10 years ago it was much worse
*** We have less ingredients in out food now, which is an imporvement
*** Food manufacturing plants are looking for ways to remove additive ingredients because that is what consumers want
** Obesity
** Sustainability

* Heat preservation
** Cooking
*** Makes food more palatable
*** renders food safe for eating
*** Provide (unlimited) vaiety in the menu
*** improves digestibility
** Sterilization
*** Complete destruction of microorgansms, bacterial spores (121C for 15 min)
*** Not used in food manufacturing
*** Used for thin materials
** Commercial Sterilization
*** Product is free of microorganisms capable of gorwing under non-refridgerated conditions
*** Product is free of microorganisms that are of public health concerns
*** Time listed (D-value) is to reduce 90% microoganisms
*** can continue reducing by 90% everytime the process is repeated
*** 12D process Cl. botulinum
**** reduces bacterial load by 99.9999999999%
**** D = 0.21 min
**** 12D = 2.43 minutes 121C
**** This time can be increased from 15-30 minutes if heating solid foods
**** Nutritional qualities are not easily reduced during heat processing, meaning the bacteria can be reduced without ruining the food
** Pasteurization
*** heat treatent employing temp below 100C for the preservation of food
*** More of a mild treatment
*** 63C-75C depending on the product and time used
*** objectives
**** destroy pathogenic microgranisms
**** extend shelf life
***** 1-2 weeks
***** 6 weeks chilled
** Blanching
*** Mild heat treatment applied to fruits and veggies prior to freeing, drying, and canning
*** Objectives
**** inactivation of enzymes
**** enhance drying/rehydration
**** removal of tissue gas
**** enhance color of green veggies
**** reduce microbial load
*** Highest temp used is 100C (boiling water)
*** Removal of enzymes is important to preserving the color and textur of the veggie
*** Freeze/dry
**** Inactivation of enzymes and enhance drying/rehydration
*** Canning
**** Removal of tissue gasses
***** This gives you a higher pressure delta between the atmosphere and the can
* Modes of heat processing (heat transfer)
** Conduction
*** Occurs in solid foods wherein energy is transfered from one molecule to another
*** Outside in
*** If the food material is too tightly packed so that it cannot move, this is the method that will be used
*** The temp difference between the inner and outer molecules of food cause the inner molecules to be the last part heated
**** Known as the cold point
** Convection
*** Heat is transfered as a result of temp gradient
*** Can be used on foods either liquid, or liquid suspensions
**** The solid pieces of food are technically heated by conduction within the liquid suspension
*** Natural
**** Thermal gradiant due to density difference in a heated product
**** Heated molecules will become less dense thus floating to the top, forcing the less dense cold molecules to the bottom, repeating this process
*** Forced
**** facilitated by mechanical agitation
** Radiation
*** Occurs as a transfer of heat energy by electromagnetic radiation
*** The pan is heated by the oven through radiation
**** then the pan heats the dough through conduction

* Heating foods in containers (also known a canning, or retorting)
** Food will cook in cans (still retorts and agitating retorts)
** A retort is a big pressure cooker
*** still retort involves no movement
*** agitating retort will spin or move its contents

* Heating food prior to packaging
** Milk pasteurization
** Batch pasteurization
*** Low temp long time (145F, 30 min)
*** High temp short time (161F, for 15 sec)
**** Will lead to milk with a shelf life of 2-3 weeks under chilled conditions
** Aseptic technique (ultra pasteurization)
*** Commercially sterilized outside the container,275F for 2-3 sec and packed aseptically
*** Packaging performed inside a sterile room
*** No need to be chilled (shelf stable milk, single serve coffee creamer)

* Cold Preservation and storage
** Refrigeration and Freezing
*** Gentle methods of food preservation
*** Reduced the rate of deterioration (but not the same degree as heat)
*** Perishables (from time of harvest/slaughter and maintained throughout prior to use)
**** Food must be kept under X degrees C constantly until eaten or used
*** Lower temp prevents or delays growth of pathogenic microorganisms
**** Under refrideration temp of 4C most things will not grow
**** But there are a few that will survive these chilled temps
*** Lower temp also prevents certain enzymes from activating and lowering food quality
*** Refrigeration
**** -2C-16C
**** Even though this temp is below freezing liquids will not freeze due to solutes present in the water
**** 4-8C household
*** Freezing
**** around -18C
**** the temp must be this low to cause water to freeze due to solute present in the liquid
** Requirements
*** Controlled low temp
**** Should be within +/- 1C of the selected temp
**** Can be selected by food type
**** Can be selected by how many people are working
***** People generate heat, so lower temperatures are required to maintain freezing or cooling
*** Air circulation and humidity
**** Dont want to fast of air, because that may dehydrate the food
**** The moisture content of the air is also important in order to keep the moisture of the food at the right level
***** Match the moisture of the food with the humidity of the air
*** Gas atmosphere
**** Controlled atmosphere storage
**** Fruits and veggies
***** Undergo respiration even after harvest
***** Gives of CO2 and requires O2
***** Normally 20% O2 and <0.1% CO2
***** To prevent this you reduce O2 and increase CO2
****** More products will shift the equilibirum towards the reactants
** Changes that Occur during Cold Preservation
*** Flavor and color
**** Color of red meat will become more brown over time
*** Nutrient Lossses
**** oxidation of nutrients
**** Vitamin C
*** Textural Changes
**** Softening of tissues
**** Staling of bread and cakes
**** lumping and caking
***** low moisture products
**** Certain fruits/veggies can become worse if they are placed in the fridge (chill injury)
** Freezing and Frozen Storage
*** convenience foods in the house
*** restraunts and institutional feeding establishments
*** Freezing point
**** temp at which liquid turns to solid
*** Freeing point depressions
**** property of aqueous solutions that leads to lower freezing point when the concentration of dissolved solids is increased
**** colligative property
**** Salt solution vs Sugar solution
***** these two will have different effects on the freezing point of water when the same weight is used
*** Concentration effects
**** if you have a solution of pure water vs a solution of orange juice, orange juice is 10-12% solutes, pure water will freeze first due to less/no solutes
**** as the portion of pure water continues to freeze the concentration of solutes in the unfrozen phase will increase, further depressing its freezing point
**** when a food item refeezes its texture will change
*** Ice crystal damage
**** Quick Freezing (more quality, commercial use)
***** happens at temps les than or equal to -25C,
***** leading to formation of small ice crystals
***** Smoother texture
**** Slow Freezing (lesser quality, home fridge/freezer)
***** happens at temps above -25C
***** formtion of large ice crystals
***** Cell walls are ruptured
** Freezing Methods
*** Air Blast (tunnel) freezing
**** Utilizes still or forced cold air
**** food placed on racks and moved into insulated tunnel
**** cold air is blown over food until product reaches 0C
*** Plate freezing
**** packaged foods are placed between metal plates which conduct cold to the product so that it reachers 0C
**** physical contact from the plates squeezing the product
*** Cryognic Freezing
**** food product is immersed or sprayed with liquid nitrogen
**** -60C
**** used for irregular shaped food
**** brine solution

* Dehydration (Heat and Mass Transfer)
** Heating the product to remove moisture
** Importance
*** Preservtion
**** Sun dried
**** Less moisture in the product will not allow microbial growth
**** Addition of salt/smoke has preservtive effect
**** Controlled condition (artifical drying)
**** Amount of moisture after dehyrdration can be as low as 1-1.5% moisture
***** Sun drying can achieve 14-15% reduction of moisture
**** Shelf life of multiple years
*** Decrease weight and bulk
**** Milk powder 1/8th weight and size
*** Convenience Items
**** pre cooked meals
** Considerations
- Surface Area
  - majority of products are converted into smaller pieces
  - leads to increased surface area
  - Heat into the product is also increase
  - leads to more moisture reduction
- Temperature
  - The greater Temp delta leads to faster dehydration
- Air velocity
  - Higher air velocity will lead to a faster dehydration
- Humidity
  - Greater humidity delta between product and air wil lead to faster and greatr dehydration
- Atmospheric Pressure
  - Lower pressure allows water to boil at lower temps
  - Faster dehydration
- Evaporations and Temp
  - When water evaporates it has cooling effect on the product
  - Air needs to keep moving
- Time an Temp
  - Depends on the specific product
  - Shorter times and Higher Temps = higher quality
** Methods
*** Air Convection Driers
**** Drying by heated air blown in a tunnel, cabinet or tray
*** Drum or Roller Driers
**** The product is dried on two heated stainless steel drums before it is scraped off
**** Hot drums cause instant drying
*** Spray Drying
**** Product is dried as it is sprayed into a chamber with hot air
**** Paste, Puree, juices, milk
**** Hot air drys the atomized product
**** upon contact there is an immediate drying of the product

* Concentration (increase in concentration of solutes, decreasing water activity)
