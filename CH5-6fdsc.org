* Food processing and preservation
** Heat
** Cold
** Dehydration
** Concentration
** Food additives
** Food Packaging

* Principles / Goals of food processing
1. Addition of heat
2. removal of heat
3. removal of moisture
4. protection - packaging material

* Importance of preservation
** Increase shelf-life of foods
** Increase availibility
*** seasonality
*** longer selling periods for fruits/veggies
** Variety and convenience
*** easy to prepare food
*** microwave dinner
** Adding value
** Providing (supplementing) nutrients

* Principles of Food Preservation
** Prevention or delay of microbial decomp
*** dehydrated/instant mash potatoes must undergo heat treatment to prevent browning of potatoes
** Killing the microorganisms
** Prevention or delay of self decomposition
** prevention of damage

* Food Processing
** transforming animal/plant/marine materials into intermediate or finished value added products
*** Any processing after killng or harvest
** Different steps that happen after harvest depending on what food is being processed
** Then the products will undergo distribution
*** packaging and shipping for different retailers
** Primary Processing
*** initial processing that occurs after harvest or slaughter to make food consumption redy, or for use in other food products
*** food can be eaten directly, otherwise it will be used to make another food product
** Secondary Processing
*** turns primary processed foods into other food products
*** creating a pineapple upsidown cake

* Food/Beverage
** 16% of all shipments in the US by value

* Unit opertions in food processing
** Unit operation = steps
** food material may be combined with a number of ingredients to formulate the product and these ingredients are subjected to different steps (unit operations) to produce the final product
** combining these unit operations will create a process flow chart
1. Heat Transfer
   - heat exchange between a product and its surrounding medium
   - cooking your product
   - must have a temperature gradient
   - heat transfer will not occur if there is no temperature difference
   - cooling a product is also considered a heat transfer
2. Mass Transfer
   - migration of constituient of fluid or a component of mixture in or out of a food product
   - seperating or removing a portion of the raw material
   - dehydrated or dried products (removing water)
3. Fluid Flow
   - Transporting fluid food through pipes during processing
4. Mixing
   - Use to evenly distribute each ingredient during manufacturing of a food product
   - during further processing it is important that food is porperly mixed so the following steps apply in th same fassion to all pieces
5. Size Adjustment
   - Food is either reduced into smaller pieces or in some instances increase in size is also possible
   - can be an increase or decrease in size
   - agglomeration - increase in size
   - gelation - forming a 3d network of proteins
6. Seperation
   - Seperation and recovery of targeted food components from a complex mixture of compounds

* Factors to consider in food processing
1. Raw material testing
2. Cleaning and sanitation
   - Clean and healthy workers
3. Engineering properties of food, biological and packaging material
   - how does a material conduct heat?
4. Acidity and water activity
   - pH and water activity of the material
5. Microbiological considerations
6. Reaction Kinetics
   - what are the changes in the componenets of the food that occur when processing is performed
   - does killing the microbacteria remove vitamins?
   - does it alter the color or taste?
   - we dont want to alter the nutritional quality by removing microorganisms/pathogens

* Emerging Issues and Sustainability in Food Processing
** Feeding the world
** Overcoming the negative perceptions about processed foods
*** 5-10 years ago it was much worse
*** We have less ingredients in out food now, which is an imporvement
*** Food manufacturing plants are looking for ways to remove additive ingredients because that is what consumers want
** Obesity
** Sustainability

* Heat preservation
** Cooking
*** Makes food more palatable
*** renders food safe for eating
*** Provide (unlimited) vaiety in the menu
*** improves digestibility
** Sterilization
*** Complete destruction of microorgansms, bacterial spores (121C for 15 min)
*** Not used in food manufacturing
*** Used for thin materials
** Commercial Sterilization
*** Product is free of microorganisms capable of gorwing under non-refridgerated conditions
*** Product is freeof microorganisms that are of public health concerns
*** Time listed is to reduce 90% microoganisms
*** can continue reducing by 90% everytime the process is repeated
*** 12D process Cl. botulinum
**** reduces bacterial load by 99.9999999999%
**** D = 0.21 min
**** 12D = 2.43 minutes
