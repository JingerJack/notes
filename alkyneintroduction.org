# +TITLE: Alkynes

* Naming practice
** 2,2,3-trimethyloct-4-yne
*** Additionally 2,2,3-trimethyl-4-octyne
** (E)6-ethyl-2-en-4-yne

* Alkynes
** C X triple bond
*** Sp hybridized
*** Also called acetylene

* Alkyne naming
** Infix -yn- 
** Number = first carbon in the triple bond
** Less priority than alkene
** -adiyn- -atriyn-

* Physical properties of alkynes
** Hydrocarbon properties

* Acidity of alkynes
** pKa of 25 in a terminal alkynes
** Triple bonds shorter than double bond
*** Negative charge more stable on a triple bond
** Bases must form weaker acids then alkynes
*** Amine bases work, alcohol bases do not
*** H- is also strong enough to work
*** NaNH2, LiN(iPr)2, NaH

* Alkylation reactions of acetylene ions (Sn2)
** Removing a terminal proton from acetylene forms acetylide ions
** No stereochemistry
** Methyl or primary alkyl halides ( undindered)
** Secondary or tertiary don't work well
** If attempted with a secondary alkyl halide E2 will take over
** Really good way to make a C C bond
*** Can be related to turn a terminal alkynes into an internal alkyne

* Alkoxide
** Negative charge on an oxygen

* Dehydrohalogenation (E2 twice)
** Internal alkyne 2 moles of base
** Terminal you need 3
** Two successive dehydrohalogenations
** Sodium amides cause this to occur rapidly
*** You can use weaker bases (OH) to only go once
** Allene formation
*** C=C=C
** R       H
**  \     /
**   C=C=C
**  /     \
** R       R


* Nomenclature
** Vicinal dihalide
*** C with the halogens are next door
** Vinyl halide
*** Halogen bonded to a Sp2 hybridized carbon

* TODO make an ochem reaction roadmap
