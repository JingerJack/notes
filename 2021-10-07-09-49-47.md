# +TITLE: Food science food safety

*Food safety (USDA definition)
** Conditions and practices they preserve the quality of the food
** Leads to the prevention of contamination and occurrence of foodborne illness
** Food safety is a concern of food production from the very beginning
** These foods undergo manufacturing and processing
*** Food safety is the number one concern during processing
**** Temperature and time in order to kill microorganisms
**** Can't just nuke food because that would remove all nutrition
**** The goal is just to kill pathogens not all microorganisms
** Distribution and delivery
*** Canned and packaged foods are under minimal concern during delivery
*** Delivery is a concern for products that must be kept cold
** Food retailers and food services
*** Grocery stores
*** Restaurants and hotels
**The consumers 
*** Consuming raw or undercooked foods is dangerous
** Food safety concerns according to the govt
1. Foodborne illness
2. Nutritional adequacy
3. Environmental contaminants
4. Naturally occurring toxicants
5. Pesticide residue
6. Food additives


* Biological hazards

** food microorganisms (minroflora)
*** Each food has a very different type of microorganisms
*** Determined by
**** Microorganisms present in the raw material
**** Microorganisms introduced during harvest, processing, and distribution (contamination)
***** This contamination will determine if your bacteria will 
****** Survive/grow or die
***** Factors in microorganism growth
****** Food characteristics
****** The organisms themselves
****** Processing/ storage conditions
******* Canned food 250F for 30min
******* Pasteurized milk 72-73C 30sec
******* The higher temp processing of canned food leads to less microorganisms allowing for longer storage, less processing equals less shelf life
** Primary microorganism of concern: Bacteria
*** Bacterial undergoes binary fission causing rapid growth and eventual dieing off

** 4 phases of growth
1. Lag phase (no change in bacteria number)
- bacterial adjustment or adaptation
2. Log phase (exponential increase in bacteria number)
- The particular food is able to promote growth of the bacterial that contaminated it
3. Stationary phase (maintaining bacterial number)
- number of dying cells and new cells being produced is equal
- nutrients present in the environment is declining provides grounds for competition
- production of bacterial waste products that are toxic
4. Death phase
- we see a rapid decline in the number of bacteria
- nutrients available are nearing zero
- waste is becoming very toxic
** Food manufacturers seek to lengthen the lag phase to demote growth
*** Proper storage conditions help this
*** The less microorganisms to start the less will grow rapidly
*** High initial contamination and poor temperature control will lead to rapidly elevated microorganism count
*** If food manufacturers are able to delay bacterial growth it will extend the usable life of the product
**** This is why rigid temperature control is very important in food processing
 
** Factors of microbial growth
*** Nutrient availability is the host food
**** Amount of N, C, H, O, and vitamins
*** pH
**** -log(H+)
**** Acidity or alkalinity (acidic or basic)
**** 1-14 range 7 is neutral
**** Neutral pH is the best for microbial growth (pH 6-8)
***** Most nutrient dense foods hover around pH of 7
*** Oxygen
**** Categories of microorganisms depending on oxygen requirements
1. Aerobic - with oxygen
2. Anaerobic - without oxygen
3. Facultative anaerobic - both
*** Water activity
**** Amount of available water in food
**** Bacterial growth requires a water activity of â‰¥0.9
**** Halophiles water activity of 0.7 to 0.75 -salt
**** Osmophiles water activity of 0.7 to 0.75 -sugar
*** Temperature
**** During storage
**** Thermophile - Greater than 45C
**** Mesophile - 20 to 45C
**** Psychrophile - lower than 20C

** Extrinsic factors
*** Oxygen and temperature

** Intrinsic factors
*** Nutrients, pH, and water activity

** Implicit factors
*** Association/characteristics of the particular microorganisms

* Chemical hazards

** Dosage or levels of specific chemicals
** Accidental, toxic metals
** Naturally occurring toxins in food
*** Pufferfish (tetrodotoxin)
*** Poisonous plants (either from contamination or naturally occurring)
** Control stages for food additives
- receipt
- use
- storage and handling
- inventory



* Physical hazards

* Foodborne illness

* Food protection systems
