# +TITLE: Alkynes and developing synthetic schemes

* Halogenation of alkynes
** 1 eq adds Br to both sides of alkyne
*** Dibromoalkene
** 2 eq adds Br to both sides twice
*** Tetrabromide 
** Anti stereoselectivity 
*** Add to opposite sides
** If done in an acidic condition it increases the preference for anti addition


* Hydrohalogenation of alkynes
** Alkynes to vinyl halides 1 eq
** Alkynes to geminal dihalide 2 eq
*** Halogens end up on the same carbon
** Marks rule due to an intermediate resonance structure when using 2 eq 

* Hydroboration-Oxidation of alkynes
** Addition of borane derivative to an alkene Yields trialkenylborane
** Syn addition
** Non marks addition
** Sia2BH
*** Sia means bulky alkanes
*** Used make it only react once
** Terminal alkyne Yields an aldehyde
*** Enol forms aldehydes because they are unstable
*** Keto-enol tautomerism under basic conditions
**** -OH removes proton
**** Draw resonance structure
**** Add proton back
**** Keto form major product
*** Move atoms around to from more stable product
*** Can happen under acidic or basic conditions
**** Basic: negative charges overall
** Keto-enol tautomerism can go backwards and forwards following the same steps
** Boron = non marks

* Acid catalyzed hydration of alkynes
** Mercury = marks 
** Major product ketone form
** Marks rule 
** Acidic tautomerism
*** Positive charges
*** Steps 
**** Add proton
**** Resonance
**** Remove proton
** Keto form product
** H adds to terminal carbon
** OH forms carbonyl on the other C
** This and the above reaction with both form ketones when an internal alkyne is used
