#+TITLE:CH10 Alcohols

* Structure of Alcohols
** Function group of an alcohol is an -OH (hydroxyl) group bonded to an sp3 hybridized carbon
*** Oxygen atom is sp3 hybridized
**** 2 sp3 hybridized orbitals form sigma bonds to a carbon and a hydrogen
**** remining two sp3 hybrid orbitals each contain an unshared pair of electrons
** Alcohols can be Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary

* Nomenclature of Alcohols
** Suffix of "-e" is changed to "-ol"
** Numbering beginds with the Carbon bearing the -OH group for cyclic alcohols
** In complex alcohols, the number for the hydroxyl group is often placed between the infix and the suffix
*** (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol
** 1-propynol
** if you have 2 alcohols
** diol, triol

* Physical porperties of Alcohols
** Alcohols ar polar compounds, thus they interact with themselves and other polar compounds (water)
*** Dipole-Dipole interactions
**** positive dipole and negative dipole interaction
*** HYdrogen Bonding
**** Attraction between dipoles when the positiv end of one dipole is a H atom bonded to O or N atoms
** The more alcohols you have the higher the boiling points due to hydrogen bonding
*** These alcohols hold themselves together very strongly
*** Alcohols are very soluble in water due to "like disolves like"

* Acidity of Alcohols
** Alcohols can function as weak acids (proton donors) and weak bases (proton acceptors)
** depending on the environment it is placed in it will change its functions
*** Acidic conditions : alcohol will function as a base
*** Basic conditions: alcohol will function as an acid
** Acidity depends primarily on the degree of stabilization and solvation of the alkoxide ion by water molecules
*** pKa of 16-18

* Acidity review
** Carboxylic acid vs Ethanol
*** Compare their conjugate bases
*** Really stable negative charges are more acidic
*** Carboxylic acid = 5
*** Ethanol = 10
** More substitued Carbons cause the pKa to increase (inductive effect)
** Comparing ethanol vs ethanol with 3 F's
*** The F pulls negative charge towards itself stabilizing the negative charge
*** Making the compound more acidic
** Adding methyl = less acidic
** Adding Halogen = more acidic

* Rxns of ALcohols with active metals
** Rxn with Li, Na, K and other active metals liberates hydrogen and forms metal alkoxides
** Rxn wirh bases stronger than the alkoxide ions converts alcohol to salts
*** One such base is sodium hydride
** Neutral O = poor nucleophile
** -OH = poor leaving group
** To make alcohols do rxn you need a very good electrophile
** Alcohols are much more reactive in strong acidic or strong basic conditions
** Basic Conditions
*** Remove H foriming an alkoxide
**** Alkoxide is a good nuc and a really strong base
**** Sn2 chem
**** E2 chem
*** Metals are strong enough to remove the H
*** NaH is also strong enough
** Acidic Conditions
*** Gains a proton
**** Adds H to form a water
*** Called Oxonium Ion
**** Very Electrophilic
**** Forms a very good leaving group in the form of water
*** Sn1/E1 Chem
**** No strong nuc or base

* Rxns of Alcohols with HX
** Tertiary Alcohols react rapidly with HCl, HBr, and HI
*** Chemists propose Sn1
**** Protonate the Alcohol
**** Water leaves
**** X attacks
** Secondary Alc
*** many give som rearrangement
*** Sn1
** Primary Unhindered Alc
*** Sn2
**** Form water
**** then backside attack with x
** Primary Hindered Alc
*** Sn1
** rxn coordinate diagram
*** Sn2 (2 steps)
**** Acid-Base is very quick
***** and exothermic
**** Sn2 is rate limiting
***** also exthermic
******** Products lower than reactants
*** Sn1 (3 steps)
**** Acid-Base
***** ecothermic and quick
**** Leaving group
***** high activation energy, high energy
**** X attacks
***** exothermic

* Lucas Reagent
** COnverts alcohols into alkyl chlorides
*** Cl- is a weaker nuc than Br
*** An additional lewis acid (ZnCl2) is sometimes added to promote the rxn of HCl with alcohols
**** Zinc coordinates more strongly than a proton does
** Primary slow, Tertiary Fast

* TODO Predict Major products
** TODO C+ rearrangements
** TODO Rearrangement and loss of water occur at the same time
bottom right = methyl shift
top right = hydride shift

* Rxn with HX limitations
1. Perent yeild is low (from primary, and secondaryalc)
2. Eliminations
   - water = good leaving group
   - E1 competes with Sn1
   - if there is heat E1 is more likely
3. Rearrangements
   - they suck
4. Limited ability to make alkyl halides
   - many alcohols do not readily react with HI to yield alkyl iodides

* rxn of alc and PBr3
** an alternative rxn for converting primary and secondary alcohols to bromoalkanes by using PBr3
*** mild conditions compard to HBr
*** rearrangements are less common, when cold
*** Involves Sn2 displacement - chiral centers inverted
** Cannot use for Tertiary alcohols
** Only use on primary and secondary alcohols
** Steps
*** O attacks P
*** kicks out 1 Br
*** PBr2 added to O
*** Br-
*** OHPBr2 = Leaving group
*** Br- attacks from the back and kicks out ^
*** inverted stereochem

* Rxn of alcohols with SOCl2
** Thionyl Chloride, SOCl2, is the most widely use reagent for the conversion of primary and seconary alcohols to chloroalkanes
** In the presence of pyridine or a tertiary amine such as NEt3
*** amide catalyzes the rnx y forming a small amount of the alkoxide in equili and neutralizes the HCl or HBr
*** Involves Sn2 displcement - chiral center inverted
** Forms SO2 and HCl
*** hence the need for a small amount of base to neutralize the HCl
*** SO2 is a gas therefore the rxn favors it
**** it goes away therefore forming even more products
** Steps
*** O attacks sulfur
*** Breaks one of the bonds between S and O
*** make the molecule neutral
*** reform O=S and kick out 1 Cl
*** Cl- grabs the H from the positive O
**** forms HCl byproduct
**** base neutralizes the acid forming conjugate base (Cl-)
*** OSOCl = leaving group
*** Backside attack by Cl- and LG leaves
** Electrons slide over to form the other O=S bond
** Cl leaves
** Turns Alcohol into a chlorine group

* Summary Day 1 Alc -> Alkyl Halides
** HX rxn works best for tertiary alc
*** C+ Sn1
*** rearrangements possible
*** racemic mix
** PBr3 and SOCl2 rxn works best for primary and secondary alc
*** Sn2
*** Chiral inverted

* Alcohols as nucleophiles
** -O = strong nuc (Sn2)
** O = weaker nuc (Sn1)
** Whe Alcohols react as a nuc the OH bond is broken

* Alcohols as electophiles
** Adding H to OH makes it a good leaving group
*** Easy under Acidic concditions
*** The problem is that Acetelyde wants to do acid/base chem before it does Substitution

* Formation of Aryl and Alkyl Sulfonates
**  Solfonyl chlorides are derivd from sulfonic acids
*** SUlfonic acid = strong acid
*** Sulfonate anion is a very weak base = good LG
** Commonly used sulfonyl chlorides
*** TsCl
*** MsCl
** A poor leaving group (OH) is converted into a good leaving group (OTs or OMs)
*** OTs= OSO2PhMe
*** Big leaving group
*** OMs = no ph instead just a methyl
*** These are a better leaving group than alkyl halides
**** This is due to resonance being stabilized across 3 O atoms
** Rxn with NaCN
*** SN2
** Rxn with NaOEt
*** E2

* Sulfonate Reactivity
** Primary, Secondary, Tertiary alcohols can be converted into sulfonates
** They can do substituiton or elimination
** SUlfonates are generally more reactive than halides
** Converting OH to OTs retains sterechemistry
*** Going from OTs to whatever then inverts the stereochem

* Acid catalyzed dehydration of an Alcohol
** Alc can be converted to an alkene by dehydration
*** Dehydration
**** elimination of a molecule of water from adjacent carbons
*** Acid catalyst
**** H2SO4 or H3PO4
*** E1 Mechanism
**** Rearrangements
**** Tertiary > Secondary >>> Primary
** Hydration vs Dehydration
*** HYdration: H20 and H2SO4
**** Tons of water an little bit of acid
*** Dehydration H2SO4 and Heat
**** Tons of acid and very little water
**** Trying to get rid of water so you dont want to start with a ton of water
** Steps (Normal E1 rxn)
1. Protonate the alcohol
   - forms HSO4- which is a poor nuc
   - Meaining Elimination is our only option
2. Water leaves on its own
   - check for rearrangements
3. That same water removes the adjecent proton forming an alkene
4. Acid is regenerated
** This rxn favors zaitsev's alkenes
** This rxn favors trans alkenes
*** Minor products
**** Cis alkenes
**** Hoffman alkenes
** If done with a Primary Alc the rearrangement will occur at the same time as the water leaving
*** Very small amount of E2 can happen

* HYdration - Dehydration equili
** Alkene hydration and alc dehydration rxn are reversible
*** Lots of water favors formation of alc
*** lots of acid favors formation of alkene

* The pinacol rearrangement (Diol to carbonyl (ketone/aldehyde))
** Products of acid-catalyzed dehydration of glycols are different from those of acid-catalyzed dehydration of alcohols
*** dehydration of a glycol to forms a carbonyl
*** Migration of a methyl group (or hydride ion) from one carbon to an adjacent carbon
** Studies of unsymmetrical vicinal diols
*** The -OH group that becomes protonated and leaves is the one that give rise to the more stable C+
** Steps
1. Protonate one alcohol
2. Water leaves
3. Methyl or Hydride shift occurs (resonance)
4. Resonance structure forms by transfering electrons from the oxygen to form a double bond
5. Remove a H with Water
6. Make sure the number of C has stayed the same

* Thiols
** Structure
*** -SH (sulfhdryl) group bonded to a sp3 hybridized carbon
** Name
*** -thiol suffix
*** maintain the "e" from the parent alkane name
** Physical Properties
*** show little association by hydrogen bonding because of the low polarity of th S-H bond
*** lower boiling points and less soluble in water
*** Low molucular weight thiols stink
**** Shunk
*** Thiols are added to natural gas so that leaks are detectible
** Chemical Properties
*** To make use RSH, with an Sn2 mechanism
*** Primary or Secondary alkyl halide as your reagent
** Acidity and Oxidation
*** Thiols are stronger acids than alcohols
*** When dissolved in a strong base they completly comvert into alkylsulfide salts
*** Sulfur can be oxidized to several higher oxidation states
**** Can have more than 8 electrons
**** octet rule violation
*** Sulfur is a good nuc because it is a weak base
**** Prefer Substitution as opposed to elimination
*** DIsulfide bonds
**** R-S-H  --> R-S-S-R
**** Oxidation

* Oxidation of Alcohols
** Oxidation of a primary alcohol gives an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid
*** depends on conditions
** Secondary alcohol -> ketone
** Tertiary alcohol -> NOTHING happends
** Mechanism
*** Most oxidizing agents simply attach a good leaving group directly to oxygen
*** E2 like rxn
*** Removal of Alpha Protons
**** Protons on the carbon bonded to O
*** Oxidation
**** Increasing C-O bonds
**** Decreasing O-H bonds
** Strength of oxidizing agent
*** Secondary = does not matter
**** forms ketone
*** Primary = both options
**** Weak = aldehyde
***** Removal of alpha proton forms double bond
**** Strong = Carboxylic acid
***** removal of alpha proton forms aldehyde
***** then OH is added
*** Tertiary = nothing :(
** Leaving groups
*** Chromium
*** Chlorine
*** Sulfur
*** Iodine
** Chromic Acid H2CrO4 (Strong oxidizing agent)
*** Secondary Alc = Ketone
*** Primary Alc = Carboxylic acid
**** oxidation is done by dissolving organic compounds in acetone and adding a stoichiometric amount of jones reagent to complete the oxidation
**** Jones reagent
***** solution of chromic acid in aqueous sulfuric acid
*** Downsides
**** Very toxic
*** Environmentaly friendly options
**** NaOCl (Bleach)
**** With acetic acid
*** Mechanism
1. Formation of an alkyl chromate
2. Take away a proton and break onds to give stable molecules or ions
**** Chromic acid oxidizes a primary alcohol first to an aldehyde then a carboxylic
***** The aldehyde is not oxidized rater the aldehyde hydrate formed by hydration
***** Requires water fo this oxidation
** PCC (weak oxidizng agent) Chromium complexed to pyridine
*** secondary alc = ketones
*** primary alc = aldehydes
*** Agents that are weak
**** PCC / Ch2Cl2
**** Swern oxidation = 1. (COCl)2, DMSO / 2. Et3N
***** environmentaly friendly PCC alternative
**** DMP
***** Dess-Martin periodinane
***** HYpervalent
****** compound with a greater electron count than predicted by the octet rule

*** Must be a cis 1,2-diol
*** Alternative to ozonolysis

* Biological Oxidation of Alcohols
** Some of the most important biochemical examples of oxidation/reduction reactions involve nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)
** One examples is the biological oxidation of alcohols via alchol dehydrogenase enzymes
