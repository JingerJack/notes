# +TITLE: Food protection systems - prevention

* Hazard analysis and critical control points (HCACP) 1970-1990
* Sanitation
* Quality assurance
* Labeling

* Common technologies
** Control point
*** A step in the process that can be controlled
** Corrective action
*** A procedure that must be implemented of there is a deviation
** Critical control point CCP
*** A step where control is applied
** Critical limit
*** Criterium that a CCP must meet
** Deviation
*** If the critical limit is not met then we have a deviation
** Hazard
*** Physical, chemical, biological hazards that make good unsafe for consumption
** Monitor
*** A procedure or method to make sure that CCP is meeting critical limit
** Risk
*** likelihood that a hazard will occur
** Sensitive ingredient
*** Associated with the term hazard, the ingredient in the production where a hazard is a concern
** Verification
*** Combining all the steps in HACCP, monitoring, recording, controlling

* HAACP steps
1. Assessing the hazards (physical, chemical, biological)
2. Identifying critical control points
3. Setting up control procedures a standards for critical control points (critical limit)
4. Monitoring critical control points
5. Taking corrective action (only if a deviation occurs)
6. Verify that the system is working
7. Develop record keeping system to document HACCP
** These steps are why the USA has the next food supply

* Sanitation - minimizing contamination
** Hygienic and healthful conditions
** Control of biological, chemical, and physical hazards on a food environments
** Application of science to provide wholesome food
*** Food was prepared by healthy workers in a clean environment

* Sanitation benefits 
** Cleaning vs sanitizing
*** Cleaning removes dirt
*** Sanitizing inactivates microorganisms
** Improved product acceptability
** Increased product shelf life
** Satisfied and delighted customers
** Reduced public health risks
** Increased trust of regulatory agencies and inspectors
** Reduced product waste and removal
** Improved employee morale

* Quality assurance
** Food quality
*** Conformance
*** Fitness for purpose
*** Degree of excellence
*** Acceptability
**** Different from person to person
** Aspects of food quality
*** Appearance
**** Size shape color structure etc 
*** Texture
**** Tenderness, crispiness
*** Flavor
**** Aroma(volatiles) and taste
***** Sweet sour salty bitter umami
*** Nutritional quality
*** Microbial load 
** Subjective vs objective

* Quality assurance procedures
** Raw and packaging materials quality
*** Raw materials will only be accepted is they meet the test standards for that material
** In line/in process product
*** Intermediate product testing, dough will not be baked if it has to much moisture
** Finished product
*** Testing texture, flavor, color
*** Company will retain a portion of the product to test expiration dates

* Labeling
** Dating
*** Open dates, code dates
*** Example, best in used by date, expiration date, pack date, pull date
**** Best in used by date means that the product has full nutritional quality
** Allergen free labeling
