# +TITLE: Ochem October 7th

* hydrohalogenation
** reagent HI, HB, Or HCl
** regioselective, marks rule
** stereochemistry na
** rearrangement possible

* mechanism
** Pi electrons remove H+ from HX and C+ forms
** halide ion attacks C+

* Halogenation
** 50/50 opposite side attachment (trans)
** No carbocation forms so no rearrangement
** Creates a racemic mixture
** Two trans molecules form and they are enantiomers
** Creates a vicinal dihalides
*** Bonded to 2 different carbons
** Stereospecific reahalogction
*** Maintain the stereotothchemistry of the reactants
*** If it starts off cis it remains cis and vis versa

* Halohydrin Formation
** Halohydrin: halo is a halogen, hydrin is water
** Halogen and alcohol on adjecent carbons
** The rxn takes place in the presence of water
*** Due to this water is the neuclophile
*** Which attacks the most substituted carbon in a triangle formation leaving OH at the most substituted C
** Halogen and OH end up on different sides
** Also forms a racemic mixture top and bottom

* Oxymercuration reduction
** 2 step sequence
** Results in the hydration of an alkene
** Creates a bridged mercurnium ion intermediate
** Starts with an alkene
*** Add OH and H across the pi bond
** No rearrangements possible
** Don't need to know the last step mechanism in this class
** Stereochemistry gets scrambled during the second step and therefore it gets cancelled out
*** 50/50 cis trans again
*** No dashes and wedges for this rxn only

* If a molecule is achiral do not worry about dashes and wedges
