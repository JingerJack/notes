# +TITLE: Ochem Chapter 6

* Day 1

* hydrohalogenation
** reagent HI, HB, Or HCl
** regioselective, marks rule
** stereochemistry na
** rearrangement possible

* mechanism
** Pi electrons remove H+ from HX and C+ forms
** halide ion attacks C+

* Halogenation
** 50/50 opposite side attachment (trans)
** No carbocation forms so no rearrangement
** Creates a racemic mixture
** Two trans molecules form and they are enantiomers
** Creates a vicinal dihalides
*** Bonded to 2 different carbons
** Stereospecific reahalogction
*** Maintain the stereotothchemistry of the reactants
*** If it starts off cis it remains cis and vis versa

* Halohydrin Formation
** Halohydrin: halo is a halogen, hydrin is water
** Halogen and alcohol on adjecent carbons
** The rxn takes place in the presence of water
*** Due to this water is the neuclophile
*** Which attacks the most substituted carbon in a triangle formation leaving OH at the most substituted C
** Halogen and OH end up on different sides
** Also forms a racemic mixture top and bottom

* Oxymercuration reduction
** 2 step sequence
** Results in the hydration of an alkene
** Creates a bridged mercurnium ion intermediate
** Starts with an alkene
*** Add OH and H across the pi bond
** No rearrangements possible
** Don't need to know the last step mechanism in this class
** Stereochemistry gets scrambled during the second step and therefore it gets cancelled out
*** 50/50 cis trans again
*** No dashes and wedges for this rxn only

* If a molecule is achiral do not worry about dashes and wedges

* Day 2

* Oxidation vs reduction
** Oxidation means losing electrons
*** Loss of H gain of O
** Reduction means gaining electrons
*** Gain of H loss of O

* Hydroboration-Oxidation
** Converts alkene to alcohol
** 2 major products 
** Syn addition ( B and H same side)
** Non marks addition
** No C+ no rearrangement
** H and B become Syn to each other 
** B adds to least substituted C
** H adds to !oat substituted C
** BH2 becomes OH

* Syn dihydroxilation
** Converts an alkene to a 1,2-diol or vicinal cool
** Both OH added in a syn fashion (cis or same side)
** No C+, therefore no rearrangement possible
** 2 step process : oxidation then reduction
*** Oxidation adds the OsO4
*** Reduction leaves behind 2 OH
** End up with the same stereochemistry as the starting material

* Catalytic Hydrogenation (reduction)
** Converts alkene to alkane
** Uses a transition metal catalyst
** Syn addition
** No C+ therefore no rearrangement
** CH2=CH2 forms CH3-CH3 by picking up H from a metal catalyst
** Both H added to the same side major product ( syn addition)
** Exothermic reaction
** Used to determine stability of alkene 
*** Heat of Hydrogenation
** Advanced research in forming chiral catalysts
*** Able to add H to a selected side
