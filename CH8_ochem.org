* Radical reactions

* Structure of alkyl halides
** Haloalkane (alkyl halide)
*** Halogen atom covalently bonded to a sp3 hybridized Carbon
*** R-X
** Haloalkene (vinylic halide)
*** Halogen atom bonded to a Carbon of a C=C bond
** Haloarene (Aryl Halide)
*** Halogen atom bonded to a benzene ring
*** Ar-X

* Alkyl Halide nomenclature (IUPAC Naming)
** Number the chain so that the first substituent has the lowest number (alkyl group or halogen)
** Use halogen prefixes in alphabetical order
***  fluoro-, chloro-, bromo-, and iodo-
** Use a number to indicate which carbon the group is located on
** Make sure the double bond has the lowest number

* Alkyl Halide Common Names
** Consist of the common name of the alkyl group followed by the name of the halide as a seperate word

* Halogenation of Alkanes
** Initiation
*** Formation of reactive intermediates (radical, anions, cations)
*** Start with nonradical or noncharged molecules
** Propigation
*** Reaction of a radical and a molelcule to form a new radical
*** Cycle continues until termination stage
*** Goes on until their is nothing left to react
** Termination
*** Destruction of reactive intermediates
*** Relatively rare compared to chain propagation steps in radical chain reaction
*** Two radicals react to form a neutral product
** Reactants
*** Cl2 and Br2 Work well
*** CH3CH3 + Cl2 -> CH3CH2Cl + HCl
** Steps
1. Initiation Break Cl-Cl Bond forming two Cl* atoms
   - using heat or light
2. Propagation 1 e- from H reacts with 1 e- from Cl*
   - forms CH3CH2* and HCl (HCl = byproduct)
3. Propagation CH3CH2* reacts with Cl2
   - forms CH3CH2Cl and Cl* (CH3CH2Cl is what we want to make)
   - also reforms the Cl* radical
4. Termination Pick two radicals to react with each other
   - Cl* + Cl* -> Cl2
   - CH3CH2* + Cl* -> CH3CH2Cl
   - CH3CH2* +CH3CH2* -> CH3CH2CH2CH3
** Stereochemistry
*** Racemic mixture if you have a chiral Carbon
** Regiochemistry
*** Different product depending on which H is removed
*** 6 H vs 2 H
**** Predicted 75 vs 25
**** observed 43 vs 57 with Cl
***** not selective
**** observed 4 vs 96 with Br
***** selective
**** Radicals formed can be tertiary, secondary, or primary
***** When Cl is used the ratio is 5:4:1 of 3*,2*,1*
****** This is due to tertiary radicals being more stable
***** When Br is used the ratio is 1600:80:1
*** To find the percent you multiply the ratio times the H available per tertiary, secondary, or primary
*** This reaction will not happen with F or I
**** HI not reactive enough, activation energy is too high, and rate it too low
**** HF too reactive, activation energy is too low, and is dangerously fast
** Hammond's Postulate
*** way to redict what the structure of a transition state looks like
*** structure of the transition state is:
**** reached early if exothermic
***** resemble the reactants
**** reached late if endothermic
***** resembles the products
*** Chlorination
**** Abstraction of H by chlorine radical is exothermic
**** Transition state is reacher early and the structure resembles the alkane and the Cl atom
***** There is little radical character on C in the transition stat
**** Regioselectivity is only slightly influenced by the relative stabilities of radical intermediates
***** Products are determined by wheter a Cl atom happens to collide with a 1*, 2*, 3* H
**** When using Cl the Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary H are very close in energy so they all have a chnace to react (hence 5:4:1 ratio)
*** Bromination
**** Removal of H by bromine radical is endothermic
***** significant radical character on C in the transition state
**** Reasons from larger stereoselectivity
***** Later transition state ad correspondingly larger difference in activation energies that causes a larger difference in reaction rates
**** Tertiary H always for bromonation
***** then secondary if needed

* Allylic Halogenation
** Allylic substitution:
*** any raction inwhichan arom or a group of atoms is substituted fo another atom or group of atoms at an allylic carbon
*** allylic carbon: carbon adjacent to a C=C bond
** an allylic C-H bond is weaker than a vinylic C-H bond
** N bromo sicinimide
*** Generates a very small amount of Br radicals over time
*** Also generates a small amount of Br2
** Major product will be Zaitsev alkene
*** Double bond may move
** Steps
1. Bromine Radical reacts with 1 e- from Allylic C-H bond
   - forms HBr (dont care about)
2. Forms a stable radical (due to resonance)
3. Most stable alkene = major product
4. Least stable alkene = minor product
5. More stable alkene reacts with Br-Br
   - forms Br* byproduct
   -

* Radical Intermdiates
** RI vs C+
*** C+ sp2 (empty p orbital)
*** RI sp2 (unpaired e- in p orital)
** Generating Radicals
*** Heat
*** Light
*** Peroxides
**** breaks O-O bond; requires little energy and proceeds at room temp
** Stability of RI
*** Tertiary > Secondary > Primary
*** More substituted = better
*** Resonance stability also helps

* Radical Addition of HBr (non mark's addition of Br)
** HBr and ROOR (PEROXIDE) (H2O2, HOOH, Peroxide, O O single bond)
** Non marks addition of HBr occurs when in the presence of peroxides or other sources of radicals are present
*** Add Br then add the H
** Marks addition occurs when radicals are absent (the more familiar way from before)
*** Add H then add the Br
** This rxn cannot occur with HCl
*** HCl bond is too strong for the abstraction of a H atom
** This rxn cannot occur with HI
*** HI is not reactive enough bcuse CI is weaker of CI
** This rxn proceedes through the most stable intermediate
** Steps
1. Initiation
   - O - O bond breaks giving 1 e- to each side
   - Oxygen radicals react with H-Br
   - Forms Br* and ROH
2. Propigation
   - alkene bond gives one e- and Br gives 1 e-
   - Last e- moves towards the most substituted C (forming a C radical)
   - Adds Br to the non-mark's position because the radical is most stable on the more substituted C
   - Radical C reacts with H-Br neutralizing that C and regenerating the Br* radical
3. Finalize
   - COmbine two radical species

* Radical Autoxidation
** Autoxidation
*** Oxidation requiring oxygen
**** occurs by a radical chain mechanism similar to that for alylic bromination
**** forms hydroperodxides
** Autoxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acid esters in cooking oils forms potentially toxic and/or cacinogenic compounds


* multistep synthesis practice
** Count C atoms in starting material and ending material
** Make C/C bonds using the acetelyde method
** Break C/C bonds with ozonolysis
** Pick a simple alkane and start exploring
