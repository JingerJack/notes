# +TITLE: Food science food safety

*Food safety (USDA definition)
** Conditions and practices they preserve the quality of the food
** Leads to the prevention of contamination and occurrence of foodborne illness
** Food safety is a concern of food production from the very beginning
** These foods undergo manufacturing and processing
*** Food safety is the number one concern during processing
**** Temperature and time in order to kill microorganisms
**** Can't just nuke food because that would remove all nutrition
**** The goal is just to kill pathogens not all microorganisms
** Distribution and delivery
*** Canned and packaged foods are under minimal concern during delivery
*** Delivery is a concern for products that must be kept cold
** Food retailers and food services
*** Grocery stores
*** Restaurants and hotels
**The consumers 
*** Consuming raw or undercooked foods is dangerous
** Food safety concerns according to the govt
1. Foodborne illness
2. Nutritional adequacy
3. Environmental contaminants
4. Naturally occurring toxicants
5. Pesticide residue
6. Food additives


* Biological hazards

** food microorganisms (minroflora)
*** Each food has a very different type of microorganisms
*** Determined by
**** Microorganisms present in the raw material
**** Microorganisms introduced during harvest, processing, and distribution (contamination)
***** This contamination will determine if your bacteria will 
****** Survive/grow or die
***** Factors in microorganism growth
****** Food characteristics
****** The organisms themselves
****** Processing/ storage conditions
******* Canned food 250F for 30min
******* Pasteurized milk 72-73C 30sec
******* The higher temp processing of canned food leads to less microorganisms allowing for longer storage, less processing equals less shelf life
** Primary microorganism of concern: Bacteria
*** Bacterial undergoes binary fission causing rapid growth and eventual dieing off

** 4 phases of growth
1. Lag phase (no change in bacteria number)
- bacterial adjustment or adaptation
2. Log phase (exponential increase in bacteria number)
- The particular food is able to promote growth of the bacterial that contaminated it
3. Stationary phase (maintaining bacterial number)
- number of dying cells and new cells being produced is equal
- nutrients present in the environment is declining provides grounds for competition
- production of bacterial waste products that are toxic
4. Death phase
- we see a rapid decline in the number of bacteria
- nutrients available are nearing zero
- waste is becoming very toxic
** Food manufacturers seek to lengthen the lag phase to demote growth
*** Proper storage conditions help this
*** The less microorganisms to start the less will grow rapidly
*** High initial contamination and poor temperature control will lead to rapidly elevated microorganism count
*** If food manufacturers are able to delay bacterial growth it will extend the usable life of the product
**** This is why rigid temperature control is very important in food processing
 
** Factors of microbial growth
*** Nutrient availability is the host food
**** Amount of N, C, H, O, and vitamins
*** pH
**** -log(H+)
**** Acidity or alkalinity (acidic or basic)
**** 1-14 range 7 is neutral
**** Neutral pH is the best for microbial growth (pH 6-8)
***** Most nutrient dense foods hover around pH of 7
*** Oxygen
**** Categories of microorganisms depending on oxygen requirements
1. Aerobic - with oxygen
2. Anaerobic - without oxygen
3. Facultative anaerobic - both
*** Water activity
**** Amount of available water in food
**** Bacterial growth requires a water activity of â‰¥0.9
**** Halophiles water activity of 0.7 to 0.75 -salt
**** Osmophiles water activity of 0.7 to 0.75 -sugar
*** Temperature
**** During storage
**** Thermophile - Greater than 45C
**** Mesophile - 20 to 45C
**** Psychrophile - lower than 20C

** Extrinsic factors
*** Oxygen and temperature

** Intrinsic factors
*** Nutrients, pH, and water activity

** Implicit factors
*** Association/characteristics of the particular microorganisms

* Chemical hazards

** Dosage or levels of specific chemicals
** Accidental, toxic metals

** Naturally occurring toxins in food
*** Pufferfish (tetrodotoxin)
*** Poisonous plants (either from contamination or naturally occurring)
*** Poisonous mushrooms
*** Food allergens
*** Big 9
1. Peanut
2. Tree nuts
3. Cows milk
4. Eggs
5. Crustacean shellfish
6. Fish
7. Soybean
8. Wheat
9. Sesame
*** When someone is allergic a particular protein fragment will make that individual produce a lot of ige
**** Rashes, shock
**** Most avoid food entirely 0.1-8 g range of toxicity
*** Celiac disease
**** Cell mediated, small intestine is disturbed by the gluten, their intestine cannot absorb it
*** Food intolerance (metabolic)
**** Lactose intolerance, lacking the enzyme
**** Sulfite induced asthma
***** Idiopathic
**** Tartazine sensitivity, Yellow 5
***** Idiopathic

** Naturally occurring contaminants in food
*** Bacterial toxins
*** Mycotoxins
- molds
- aflatoxin
- fumonisins
*** Algal toxins
- marine algae
- red tide
- ingested by shellfish and fish

** Potentially toxic man-made chemicals
*** Intentionally or unintentionally added
*** Food additives
- not a major concern as the degree of hazard is quite low
- sodium nitrite, sorbitol
*** Agricultural chemicals
- residues
- insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, fertilizers, veterinary drugs and antibiotics
*** Chemical migration
- from packaging materials and containers
- bisphenol A BPA
*** Intentional adulterants
- melamine in milk
-  cyanuric acid
- used to artificially bump nitrogen (protein) content


** Control stages for food additives
- receipt
- use
- storage and handling
- inventory



* Physical hazards
** Foreign objects
** Harvesting, manufacturing, or intrinsic to the food

** Unavoidable extraneous materials
- byproduct of the processing system or something inherent to the product
- stems in berries, dirt on potatoes

** Avoidable extraneous materials

* Food spoilage
** Unfit for human consumption
** Decomposition and putrefaction (rotting)
** Changes color, flavor, texture, and odor
** Entirely different from food borne illness
** This makes the food undesirable to consume

** Physical changes
*** Color and texture of the food

** Chemical changes
*** Odor compounds
*** Production of acids (smell of spoiled meat)
*** Souring from lowered pH

* Foodborne illness
** Food and waterborne illness
** Not obvious like spoilage
** Consumption of food that is contaminated by a pathogenic organism
** Cannot see the contamination

** Foodborne outbreak
*** At least two people that are suffering from the same disease, and it can be priced that it was caused by the same type of food

** Contributory factors
*** Preparation in advance
*** Storage at ambient T
*** Undercooking
*** Cross contamination
*** Improper handling
*** Infected food handlers
*** Used of leftovers

** Bacterial origin
*** food intoxication (toxins produced by microorganism)
**** staphylococcus aureus
*** food infection (ingestion of live microorganisms)
**** salmonella
*** food toxicoinfection (live microorganisms ingested and then produce toxins)
**** clostridium perfringens

** What contributes to emergence
*** Changes in eating habits
*** Changes in perception and awareness
*** Demographic changes
**** Young, old, pregnant, immunocompromised
*** Changes in food production and processing
*** Changes in food handling and preparation
*** Changes in the behavior of microorganisms
*** Globalization of food supply
** Leads to a food recall

** Foods protection systems
