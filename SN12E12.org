#+DESCRIPTION: Nucleophilic Substitution and beta elimination

* Nucleophilic Substitution
** Any reaction in which one nucleophile is substituted for another at a tetravalent carbon
** Replace a halogen with a nucleophile
** The resulting functional group depends on the nucleophile you start with
** Factors influencing nucleophilicity
*** Charge
**** Negative vs neutral, negative wins
*** Electronegativity
**** As EN decreases nucleophilicity increases
*** Sterics
**** The more branched a nucleophile is the slower it reacts
*** Solvent
**** The less the nucleophile reacts with the solvent the greater it wants to react
1. Polar aprotic solvent
- cannot participate in H bonding with nucleophile
- Nucleophilicity increases as you go up a column
2. Polar protic solvent
- can participate in H bonding with nucleophile
- Nucleophilicity increases as you go down a column, in the same solvent


* Sn2 Reaction
** Substitution, nucleophilic, 2nd order overall 
** Replacing the halogen with a nucleophile
** Carbon must be sp3 hybridized
** Halogen called leaving group
** Nucleophile attacks from the opposite side of the leaving group, backside attack
*** This backside attack results in an inversion
*** S to R and R to S
** For an Sn2 reaction it must be a good or moderate nucleophile
*** Good nucleophiles have negative charges
*** Moderate nucleophiles are either neutral or stabilized by resonance
*** Poor nucleophiles are neutral oxygen's
** Rate = k[HO-][CH3Br]
*** First order in respect to nucleophile, first order in respect to the carbon, 2nd order overall
** Primary > Secondary >>> Tertiary alkyl halides
*** Less bulky groups in the way of the C allow the reaction to proceed faster
** The leaving group
*** More stable leaving groups alone are more willing to leave
*** More electro negative are more willing to leave
*** Going up a column increasing willingness to leave
** The solvent
*** Best solvent is a polar aprotic solvent
**** Solvent does not interact with nucleophile as much allowing it to react faster
** If a molecule is achiral you do not need to worry about stereochemistry


* Sn1 Reaction
** Substitution, nucleophilic, 1st order overall
** Carbon must be sp3 hybridized
** Step 1 leaving group leaves all by itself
*** Forms a C+
**** Tertiary > Secondary >>>> Primary alkyl halides reaction rate
**** Stereochemistry results in a mixture of inversion and retention depending on which side of the P orbital the nucleophile attacks (racemic mixture)
**** Because of the C+ formation rearrangements are possible
** Step 2 nucleophile attacks C+
** Step 3 AB reaction neutralizes the O by removing a H
** Rate = k[C(CH3)2Br]
*** Nucleophile concentration does not change rate
** For a Sn1 Reaction polar protic solvents are next because they can help stabilize the C+
** Poor nucleophiles typically react via Sn1 
*** O's that are neutral
** More stable C+ react faster
** Same trends for leaving groups

* Sn2 vs Sn1
** Types of alkyl halides
*** Methyl CH3X
**** Sn2 yes, Sn1 doesn't happen C+ unstable
*** Primary RCH2X
**** Sn2 yes, Sn1 rarely occurs 
*** Secondary R2CHX
**** Sn2 yes, Sn1 yes, depends on solvent and nucleophile type
*** Tertiary R3CX
**** Sn2 no. Sn1 yes

* Beta elimination
** Dehydrohalogenation
** A halogen and hydrogen are removed forming an alkene
** Halogen is removed from one carbon
** Hydrogen is removed from neighboring carbon

* Zaitsev's rule
** Want to for the most stable alkene possible
** The more substituted an alkene is the more stable it is
** You have to remove the beta proton from the most substituted carbon

* E1 reaction
** Elimination, unimolecular
*** Unimolecular means only one species is involved in the rate determining step
*** Rate = k[electrophile]
** First step is rate determining
** sp3 hybridized carbon has a halogen removed turning it into a C+
** Hydrogen is then removed from one carbon leaving us with an alkene
** Halogen leaving group step fully completed before beta hydrogen is removed
** The hydrogen is removed via a base
*** Weaker bases prefer the E1 reaction
** Tertiary > Secondary >>> primary C+
** Rearrangements are possible due to C+ formation
** Solvent for E1
*** Polar protic solvents are best
** E1 and Sn1 are competing reactions

* E2 reaction
** Rate = k[electrophile][base]
** Take a proton away and at the same time break a bond to give stable molecules or ions
** Stereochemistry
*** Halogen and beta proton must be in the anti-coplanar formation 
*** opposite sides in the same plane
*** You will have to twist the molecule in order to make it line up correctly
** No C+ formation so no rearrangement
** Must follow Z's rule
*** Z's rule applies if you have a small unhindered base
**** -OH -OCH3 -OEt
*** Hofmann's rule applies with big bulky bases
*** Small bases can remove the Z proton
*** Big bases must remove the non Z proton (Hofmann)
** Sn2 vs E2
*** E2 strong base
*** E2 Tertiary fastest
*** The only reaction that Tertiary is not the fastest is Sn2
** If the halogen is equatorial the reaction cannot proceed
*** Have to make the halogen axial 

* E1 vs E2
** Oxygen with - is strong
** Oxygen neutral is a weaker base
** Strong bases do E2
** Weaker bases do E1

* TODO Practice of reactions 
* TODO Create 1 sheet to compare reactions
1. Mechanism is concerted 

2. Yields alkene as a major product 
E1 and E2
3. Reaction is first order overall
Sn1 E1
4. Requires a strong base
E2
5. Involves complete inversion at chiral center
6. Tertiary alkyl halides teacher faster than primary alkyl halides
7. Rearrangements are possible
8. Requires a good leaving group
9. Forms a radical intermediate
10. Rate will double is concentration of nucleophile is doubled
11. Completed with E1
12. Requires anti coplanar conformation
13. Alkyl halides can be sp2 hybridized
14. Generally accelerated in protic solvents
15. Forms racemic product at chiral center

* Sn1 vs E1 
** Difficult to predict the radio between them

* Sn2 vs E2
** Branching at alpha or beta carbon
*** Increasing steric hinderence decreases the rate of Sn2 and increase E2
** The greater Nucleophilicity of the attacking regent more Sn2 and the greater basicity of the attacking reagent more E2
*** Substitution if pKa <11
*** Elimination if pKa >11
** Higher temperature favors elimination, lower temperature favors Substitution

* Flowchart ( look at textbook)
1. R group is primary and stericly undindered
