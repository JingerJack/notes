#+TITLE: Alkynereduction

* Reduction of Alkynes
** H2/Pd = Alkane (syn addition, concerted)
*** adding hydrogen across the pi bond twice
*** Almost always happens twice, not very likely to only add one set of hydrogens
** H2/Lindlar's Cat = cis-alkene (syn addition, concerted)
*** Lindlar's cat = powdered Pd metal deposited on CaCO3 that has been poisond with Pd salts and quinoline
**** weaker catalyst, meaning the rxn only happens once
*** both H add to the same side due to how the alkyne sits on the catalyst
** Na/NH3 = trans-alkene (anti-addition)
*** H adds to opposite sides
*** due to this the H's are added at different times (step-wise mechanism)
*** Na + NH3(l)
**** Na dissolved creates a Na(1+) ion
***** Na loses 1 electron
**** This extra electron is stabilized by the NH3 floating around
**** When moving electrons use a double headed arrow for lone pair
**** use a fishhook arrow for 1 electron
**** Step for Mechanism
1. add e- (creates a radical anion, trans intermediate)
2. add H+ (from NH3, creates a vinyl radical)
3. add e- (repeat 1, from Na+)
4. add H+ (repeat 2, from NH3, forming a trans alkene)
** BH3 can also be used as lindlar's catalyst
** Whe perofrming this last 2 rnx on a terminal alkyne the result will be the same because of the H on one end
